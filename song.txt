I was so high I did not recognise
the fire burning in her eyes
the chaos that control my mind.

Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

This love has taken it's toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice, cause I won't say goodbye anymore

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again

This love has taken it's toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice, cause I won't say goodbye anymore
